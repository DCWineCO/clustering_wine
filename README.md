### Data Dictionary 
Description of attributes:

* fixed acidity: most acids involved with wine or fixed or nonvolatile (do not evaporate readily)

* volatile acidity: the amount of acetic acid in wine, which at too high of levels can lead to an unpleasant, vinegar taste

* citric acid: found in small quantities, citric acid can add 'freshness' and flavor to wines

* residual sugar: the amount of sugar remaining after fermentation stops, it's rare to find wines with less than 1 gram/liter and wines with greater than 45 grams/liter are considered sweet

* chlorides: the amount of salt in the wine

* free sulfur dioxide: the free form of SO2 exists in equilibrium between molecular SO2 (as a dissolved gas) and bisulfite ion; it prevents microbial growth and the oxidation of wine

* total sulfur dioxide: amount of free and bound forms of S02; in low concentrations, SO2 is mostly undetectable in wine, but at free SO2 concentrations over 50 ppm, SO2 becomes evident in the nose and taste of wine

* density: the density of water is close to that of water depending on the percent alcohol and sugar content

* pH: describes how acidic or basic a wine is on a scale from 0 (very acidic) to 14 (very basic); most wines are between 3-4 on the pH scale

* sulphates: a wine additive which can contribute to sulfur dioxide gas (S02) levels, wich acts as an antimicrobial and antioxidant

* alcohol: the percent alcohol content of the wine

* red: the type of wine 

* white: the type of wine
